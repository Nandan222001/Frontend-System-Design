# 🌐 REST API Overview

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It relies on a **stateless**, **client-server** communication model and uses standard **HTTP methods** for operations. REST APIs are widely used for building web services that enable different systems to communicate over the internet.

## 📘 What is a REST API?

A **REST API** is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services using **HTTP**.

### 🔥 Key Benefits:
- 📚 **Ease of Use** – Uses standard HTTP methods
- 🔁 **Stateless** – Each request is independent
- 📈 **Scalable** – Efficient for high-traffic systems
- 🧩 **Flexible** – Returns data in JSON, XML, etc.
- 🧵 **Uniform Interface** – Consistent way to interact with resources
- 🗂️ **Cacheable** – Boosts performance with caching
- 🧠 **Separation of Concerns** – Client & server evolve independently
- 🌍 **Interoperable** – Cross-platform & multi-language support
- 🔐 **Secure** – Supports HTTPS, API Keys, OAuth, etc.

## ❓ Why Use REST APIs?

- 🧭 Platform-independent communication  
- 🔧 Easy integration with frontend/mobile apps  
- ⚙️ Simpler backend logic due to stateless requests  
- 🛡️ Built-in HTTP security & reliability

## 🧱 Building Blocks

| Component     | Description                                                  |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **URL**        | The endpoint representing a resource                        |
| **Methods**    | `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.                        |
| **Headers**    | Meta-information (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization)       |
| **Status Codes** | HTTP responses like `200 OK`, `404 Not Found`, etc.      |
| **Request**     | Contains method, URL, headers, and optional body          |
| **Response**    | Server reply with data and status                         |

## 🧪 Building and Testing Apps

- 🧰 **Postman** – Test REST APIs with GUI interface  
- 📜 **Swagger / OpenAPI** – Auto-document and test APIs interactively

## 🌐 HTTP Versions

| Version   | Features                                                              |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **HTTP/1.1** | Persistent connections, standard REST support                     |
| **HTTP/2**   | Multiplexing, header compression, better performance              |
| **HTTP/3**   | Based on QUIC protocol, faster, more secure, and reliable         |

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use **plural nouns** for endpoints: `/users`, `/products`
- Use **HTTP status codes** appropriately
- Keep it **stateless**
- Use **pagination** for large data sets
- Secure endpoints with **authentication & authorization**
- **Version** your APIs: `/api/v1/...`

## 🚀 Advanced Topics

| Feature        | Purpose                                           |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 🔐 **Authentication** | Verify identity using API keys, JWT, OAuth   |
| ⚡ **Caching**         | Boost response speed & reduce load          |
| ⏱️ **Rate Limiting**   | Prevent abuse by limiting requests           |
| 📄 **Pagination**      | Manage large data sets effectively          |
| 🆕 **Versioning**      | Maintain backward compatibility              |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### 🧱 2-Tier Architecture

- **Client**: UI or app that sends requests  
- **Server**: Backend service that processes requests and returns data

### 🏗️ 3-Tier Architecture

- **Client**: The user interface  
- **Server**: Processes business logic  
- **Database**: Stores and retrieves data
